## Used a OOPS model of Programming.
<li> Defined a class with the local variables - int key, String url, int count
<li> Each time a new URL is to be stored in the database(with local variables) then the constructor of the class is intialized 
<li> So each object acts as a primary key for each url being stored.
<li> All these objects of the class are stored inside an ArrayList so that they can be listed down when the list command is executed.
<li> Switch case is used to define the various commands and it is made more user friendly.
<li> Interface is in a user understandable format.
